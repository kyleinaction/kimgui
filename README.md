## About
Kimgui (Kha Immediate Mode Graphical User Interface) is an immediate mode graphical user interface for Kha written in Haxe. Inspired by Zui from Armory, and Dear ImGui. The primary goals for Kimgui are:

- [] Minimal UI state storage - application state should have one source of truth.
- [] No callbacks - draw and accept user input inline.
- [] Layout system that supports window docking.
- [] Easy to theme.
- [] Easy to extend and add new elements.
